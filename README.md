### Shop-sales-prediction
This project predicts sales of shops. The data is one obtained from a Kaggle learning data-set. Different combinations of stackings of LightGBM, Catboost and XGboost were
tested but sufficient RMSE error could not be obtained due to limitation of computing resources ( unable to do hyperparameter tuning ). However, after consultations 
from various other Kernels and using trial and error an acceptable RMSE error was obtained but it definitely has a lot of room for improvement
